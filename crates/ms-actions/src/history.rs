/*
File: crates/ms-actions/src/history.rs

Purpose:
Generic in-memory undo/redo engine `ActionHistory<A>` over any `ReversibleAction`.
Mirrors the semantics of Koharu's `history.rs` undo/redo stacks (apply pushes to
undo and truncates the redo branch; undo applies the inverse and keeps the
original for redo) but is fully generic and has NO durable log — the append-only
history log is a later, optional phase.

Key items:
- struct `ActionHistory<A>`

Notes:
GUI-free; holds no locks and does no I/O. All heavy work lives inside the
action's `apply`/`inverse`, which the caller schedules off the GUI thread as
needed.

/// In-memory undo/redo engine for a single action type `A`.
///
/// Holds two stacks: `undo` (oldest at the front, newest at the back) and
/// `redo`. `apply` runs an action forward and records it for undo, truncating
/// the redo branch. `undo` applies the action's inverse and preserves the
/// original on the redo stack; `redo` re-applies it.
///
/// The undo stack is bounded two ways, evicting oldest-first (front): a count
/// cap (`limit`) and an optional total-bytes cap (`weight_budget`) summed over
/// [`ReversibleAction::weight`]. The running total is tracked incrementally in
/// `undo_weight` (never recomputed by iteration). The weight budget applies to
/// the UNDO stack only — redo weight is intentionally not budgeted, keeping the
/// bookkeeping simple; the redo branch is bounded in practice because it is
/// truncated on every fresh edit. A single undo entry larger than the whole
/// budget is still retained (you cannot drop the only undo step).
