File: crates/ms-text-render/src/font_system_pool.rs

Purpose:
Process-global checkout pool of reusable `cosmic_text::FontSystem` instances so
that renders do not re-run the expensive system-font scan on every call.

Why a pool and not a thread_local:
Renders run on freshly spawned, short-lived worker threads (live-edit render,
created overlays, preview tiles). A `thread_local!` `FontSystem` would be
re-initialized (re-paying the system-font scan) on every new thread and give
almost no benefit on the hot live-edit path. A process-global pool survives
across threads, so a `FontSystem` built once is leased by whichever thread
renders next.

Main responsibilities:
- own a bounded, mutex-guarded free list of `PooledFontSystem` items;
- lease a `FontSystem` + its per-system `FontFaceCache` for the duration of one
  render and return it afterward (`with_leased_font_system`);
- bound growth by dropping systems whose face cache or the pool itself has grown
  past fixed limits (resets cosmic-text shaping/db growth on a long-lived
  `FontSystem`);
- expose `prewarm_font_system_pool` so the application can pay the first scan on
  a background thread before the first user render.

Key structures:
- `FileKey`: identity of a font file for dedup (path + length + mtime).
- `FontFaceCache`: per-`FontSystem` map of already-loaded font files, plus the
  pristine default-family names captured at system creation and a determinism
  taint flag.
- `PooledFontSystem`: a `FontSystem` bundled with its `FontFaceCache`.

Determinism guards (renderer requires byte-identical output for identical params
even on a reused pooled system):
- Pristine default families: a fresh `FontSystem::new()` seeds fontdb generic
  families (sans-serif/serif/monospace/cursive/fantasy). `FontFaceCache::for_system`
  captures those names once so a render whose selected face has NO family name can
  RESTORE them instead of inheriting a prior render's family (see
  `font_registry::apply_default_families`).
- Taint-and-drop: font matching is by family name. If two DIFFERENT files
  (different `FileKey`) declare the same `(family, weight, style, stretch)`,
  cosmic-text may resolve `Family::Name` to the wrong (earlier-loaded) face —
  history-dependent. The loader marks the cache `tainted` on such a collision and
  `return_to_pool` DROPS a tainted system so it can never serve a future render.
  Documented residual: the single render that first triggers the collision may
  still mis-match before the system is dropped (rare, self-healing).

Notes:
`FontSystem` is `Send` but not `Sync`; ownership is moved in/out of the pool
under a `Mutex`, so nothing is shared while leased. `with_leased_font_system`
uses no Drop guard (a guard would need `Option` + `unwrap`); a panic inside the
closure leaks that one system, which the pool simply recreates, and the renderer
must not panic anyway.
