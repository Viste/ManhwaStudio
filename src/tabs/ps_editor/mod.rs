/*
File: tabs/ps_editor/mod.rs

Purpose:
Orchestrates the "PS-подобный редактор" tab: a standalone, single-page, layered editor that is
deliberately NOT a `CanvasView`. It owns its own pan/zoom viewport, layer stack, selection, tool
set, and tiled GPU cache.

Key structures:
- `PsEditorTabState`: the tab state held by `MangaApp`.

Architecture:
- `viewport`: own camera (pan/zoom/fit), independent of the shared canvas engine.
- `layers`: ordered layer stack with two locked base layers (source + clean) and user raster
  layers above them.
- `page_loader`: background worker that produces the two base-layer images for the active page.
- `layer_render`: per-layer tiled texture cache (budgeted upload, dirty tiles).
- `tools`: `PsTool` trait + selection/brush tools; the tab routes pointer input to the active tool.
- raster effects: applying a non-destructive effects chain runs the expensive
  `apply_effects_to_color_image` on a worker thread (`render_ps_raster_effects`), never the GUI
  thread. `apply_effects_to_raster` clones the base pixels and spawns the render (stashing a
  latest-wins request via `pending_raster_effects` if one is already in flight);
  `poll_ps_raster_effects_jobs` (once per frame) does the cheap GUI-side apply (recenter, doc
  routing, reversible persist). Mirrors the typing tab's `apply_raster_effects_edit` pipeline.

Notes:
Base layers mirror existing models read-only and are never written back. User raster layers are
session-scoped in memory (kept per page); on-disk persistence is a future phase.
