/*
File: src/tabs/typing/render_next/glyph_blit.rs

Purpose:
Shared outline-blit helpers for the vector-glyph render paths. Both the
horizontal renderer (`pipeline.rs`) and the on-path / formula / custom-line
composite pass (`formula/render.rs`) resolve a glyph's true font outline and
place it with the same pen-relative pivot, so a glyph rasterized from its
outline lands on exactly the pixels the old bitmap blit would have drawn.

Key functions:
- hash_font_id: stable `u64` identity for a `fontdb::ID` (slotmap key with no
  public numeric accessor) to key the `OutlineCache`.
- resolve_outline_for_glyph: per-render cached outline lookup for a laid-out
  glyph at its shaped em size.
- glyph_outline_transform: local->world `GlyphTransform` reproducing the bitmap
  blit's scale+rotation about the bitmap center (the single source of truth for
  the outline->world pivot).

Notes:
These helpers were lifted out of `formula/render.rs` so the horizontal path can
share them instead of duplicating the pivot math. The extraction em is the
glyph's shaped `font_size` (the exact ppem the bitmap path feeds to swash);
per-glyph scale is applied later as a transform, never baked into the outline.
