# Module: src/launcher/new_project

## Purpose
Detached "New Project" launcher window. This module gathers source pages, prepares ribbon images,
downloads or imports external chapter content, and saves the resulting project without blocking the
main launcher UI.

## Architecture
UI-facing state lives in `window.rs`. It owns the native/embedded viewport, form state, ribbon
preview, crop/manual-cut UI, and event polling. Long-running behavior is split into controller
modules that expose `begin`/`poll` style APIs over channels: source import, project catalog/save,
quick download, advanced Selenium download, stitching, waifu2x, clipboard/screen capture, and
batch processing.

Image import normalizes external files into `ImportedImage` and `RibbonPage` values from
`ribbon.rs`. File image formats are detected from file signatures before decoding; extensions are
used only for picker filters, archive type selection, and lightweight name ordering where bytes are
not yet available.

The ribbon model is the in-memory handoff between acquisition and save/export. Import/download
modules produce decoded images, `ribbon.rs` builds tiled previews while preserving source pixels and
crop metadata, and `project_io.rs` writes selected images to `src`, `alt_vers`, or an arbitrary
folder. Browser automation no longer spawns its own Python helper: the Selenium/CloakBrowser session
runs inside the app-global AI backend and is driven over framed IPC (`backend_ipc`, method
`browser.command`). `advanced_download.rs` translates each legacy command into one streaming IPC call
(progress frames + a terminal event); if the backend is not running it asks the supervisor
(`ai_backend_supervisor::global_handle`) to start it before issuing commands.

## Files and submodules
- `mod.rs`: public module map for the detached new-project window.
- `window.rs`: `NewProjectWindowState`, viewport rendering, left-panel modes, ribbon preview,
  crop/manual cut UI, save forms, controller polling, and open-project handoff after save.
- `open_source.rs`: source picker and workers for folders, saved HTML, archives, and single image
  files; includes byte-signature image detection, natural ordering, filtering, and progress events.
- `project_io.rs`: projects-root catalog scan, target resolution, parallel PNG save pipeline, and
  save result mapping back to `OpenProjectSelection` where applicable.
- `quick_download.rs`: direct chapter downloader for supported sites, URL extraction, parallel
  image download/decode, and ribbon conversion.
- `advanced_download.rs`: advanced browser bridge over the unified backend's `browser.command` IPC
  (Selenium or CloakBrowser, selected via `set_backend`), backend start-gate, helper version checks,
  backend selection, pattern link collection, cancellable auto link candidate grouping/review,
  responsive candidate-card layout, direct fetch, canvas snapshot, canvas intercept workflows, and
  Cloak-only deep capture that returns byte-classified candidates through the same auto-review path.
- `stitching.rs`: vertical stitch/split heuristics, heterogeneous-bottom adjacent-page merge,
  cut-like-reference, manual cut apply, progress events, and synchronous helpers reused by batch
  execution.
- `waifu2x.rs`: platform runtime discovery/download/extraction, dynamic shared-library loading,
  cached model/context lifetime, cancellation, worker processing, and synchronous helpers reused by
  batch execution.
- `reline.rs`: worker bridge to the already running Python AI backend `/reline/process` and
  `/reline/models` endpoints; it writes temporary PNG inputs/outputs, converts processed images
  back into ribbon pages, and loads the available Reline model catalog for UI selection.
- `reline_models.rs`: pure, offline classification of catalog model names into gallery categories
  with friendly titles, capability descriptions, and recommendations (curated table plus a
  name-derived heuristic fallback). No UI, no network; consumed by the simplified Reline gallery in
  `window.rs`.
- `ribbon.rs`: `RibbonState`, `RibbonPage`, `RibbonTile`, `RibbonCrop`, `ImportedImage`, tiled
  preview generation, adjacent page merge, non-destructive crop state, and original-page
  restoration.
- `batch_processing/`: standalone visual graph editor and executor for repeated import/download,
  browser, stitch, waifu2x, and save pipelines. See `batch_processing/MODULE_README.md`.

## Contracts and invariants
- GUI code must only poll worker state. Decoding, filesystem traversal, archive extraction,
  downloads, Selenium calls, image processing, screen/clipboard capture work, waifu2x runtime
  loading, and PNG saving stay off the main thread.
- Unsupported or unreadable sources must return user-facing errors plus detailed log messages; do
  not add fake pages or placeholder outputs.
- Imported pages preserve stable natural ordering before ribbon construction.
- Source images are decoded from real bytes, not from filename labels.
- Ribbon pages retain original pixels and crop metadata so crop/restore operations are
  non-destructive.
- Browser automation must go through the unified AI backend over `backend_ipc` (method
  `browser.command`); the live browser session lifecycle is owned by the backend's `BrowserService`,
  not by spawning a Python child here. The backend process itself is owned app-globally by
  `ai_backend_supervisor`; `new_project` only requests a start (start-gate) if it is not running.
- Cloak deep capture is a review-mode acquisition path: Rust only starts/stops/status-polls the
  session and must keep decoded results behind the existing auto-review window before adding them to
  the ribbon. Cloak + deep capture is the default backend/mode. The simple-mode "Автоматический
  перехват картинок" section is a thin entry point into this same path: it shares the advanced
  download state (`advanced_page_url`, `advanced_intercept_*`) and reuses the advanced wrappers, but
  first calls `prepare_simple_deep_capture` to force Cloak + `DeepCapture` since it has no
  backend/mode selectors.
- The advanced downloader version is read via the `version` command (`downloader_version`); Rust
  compares it with `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` and shows a session-only warning on mismatch.
- Waifu2x must keep the application usable when the shared library is absent; the worker either
  downloads/extracts the real runtime or returns a clear error.
- Reline processing depends on an externally running AI backend reached through `crate::backend_ipc`
  (HTTP/1.1 over the AF_UNIX socket); `reline.rs` uses `get_request`/`post_json` and no longer uses
  `ureq`. The launcher must not start that backend from `new_project`; it should report connectivity
  or backend errors clearly.

## Editing map
- To change source picking or image import, edit `open_source.rs`.
- To change direct supported-site downloading, edit `quick_download.rs`.
- To change Selenium/browser download, link collection, or canvas capture, edit
  `advanced_download.rs`.
- To change save/export behavior or project catalog scanning, edit `project_io.rs`.
- To change ribbon page state, tiling, adjacent page merge, crop metadata, or original-page restoration, edit
  `ribbon.rs`.
- To change stitch/split, heterogeneous-bottom merge, or cut behavior, edit `stitching.rs`.
- To change waifu2x runtime discovery, package download, cancellation, or processing, edit
  `waifu2x.rs`.
- To change Reline backend request shape, temporary file handoff, model-catalog loading, or
  response parsing, edit `reline.rs`.
- The Reline section in `window.rs` has two modes behind a persisted toggle (simplified by
  default, full/expert behind it). To change model categories, descriptions, or recommendations
  shown in the simplified gallery, edit `reline_models.rs`; to change the simplified controls or
  preset-to-pipeline mapping, edit `show_reline_simple`/`build_reline_simple_options` in
  `window.rs`.
- To change detached window UI flow or controller wiring, edit `window.rs`.
- To change batch graph editing or execution, edit `batch_processing/`.
