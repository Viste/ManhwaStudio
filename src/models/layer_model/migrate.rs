/*
File: models/layer_model/migrate.rs

Purpose:
One-shot EAGER migration of a legacy text chapter (`text_info.json`) into the canonical schema-v3
inline `layers.json` form, run once in the background on chapter open. The lazy on-read migration
(`layer_doc::ensure_page_loaded`) still handles display correctness frame-to-frame; this module makes
the rewrite happen up-front and PERSISTENTLY, so a chapter is converted once and never re-read from
`text_info.json` afterwards.

Design (per user decisions):
- Pixels are PRESERVED by RENAMING (moving) the existing overlay PNG into the v3 uid-keyed name
  (`persist::text_image_file_name`) in the canonical committed `layers/` dir — never re-rendered.
- `text_info.json` becomes `text_info.json.bak` (the rollback anchor) — and only AFTER `layers.json`
  for every page has been written and PNGs renamed, so a crash mid-migration leaves the legacy file
  intact and migration simply re-runs.
- Geometry decode reuses the SHARED codec (`text_payload`), with the FULL chapter `page_sizes` map so
  the absolute-ribbon family resolves correctly.

This module owns no UI / image-render code: it only moves files and rewrites `layers.json` through
the existing `persist` writers. The typing tab spawns it on a worker thread and evicts the doc pages
on completion so both tabs re-project the migrated v3 data.
