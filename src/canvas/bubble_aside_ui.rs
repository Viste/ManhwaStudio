File: src/canvas/bubble_aside_ui.rs

Purpose:
Aside bubble UI subsystem for `CanvasView`: column layout, repack, link rendering,
hit-testing, and drag interactions for side-mounted bubbles.

Main responsibilities:
- layout aside items (whole bubbles, or one per image text area) into left/right columns;
- optionally split a side into two side-by-side columns (near/far) when room allows;
- render bubble cards and per-area anchor links without pulling persistence into UI code;
- render the editable multi-area image bubble card (preview, framed row blocks, add/remove area);
- manage aside drag lifecycle for bubble-body, rect-area, and image red-rect/area/anchor moves;
- keep runtime bubble geometry in sync with scene interactions.

Key functions:
- draw_aside_for_page()
- draw_aside_side()  -> single- vs two-column dispatch per side
- draw_aside_column() / draw_aside_two_columns()
- build_aside_desired_slots() -> pack_aside_slots() -> draw_aside_slots()
- draw_editable_image_areas()
- draw_image_bubble_page_overlay()
- aside_hit_test()
- drag_aside_by_pointer()

Notes:
- Layout is split into three reusable stages: build desired slots (measure), pack them vertically
  (pure geometry in `pack_aside_slots`, unit tested), then draw the packed slots.
- The per-cluster crossing minimizer inside `pack_aside_slots` is the audited low-zoom hot spot
  (one ~48-card cluster, O(n^3) swap loop per frame). It is now bounded (`ASIDE_PACK_MAX_PASSES`)
  and memoized across frames: the converged item ordering is cached in egui temp data keyed by an
  exact-bit cluster fingerprint (`cluster_crossing_fingerprint` / `hash_crossing_coord`), so a steady
  camera replays the stored permutation instead of recomputing. The fingerprint hashes the exact
  IEEE-754 bits of every crossing-relevant coordinate (not a coarse quantization bucket): the crossing
  decision in `lines_cross` is a pure function of those coordinates and amplifies them by an unbounded
  slope ratio near its `0.0001` denominator guard, so any quantization larger than the `±0.001`
  comparison epsilon could let a cache hit replay a stale, link-crossing layout. The cache mirrors the
  `helpers.rs` text-measure cache (bounded `Arc<Mutex<HashMap>>`, clear-on-overflow); unit tests pass
  `None` for the pure path.
- Two-column mode (`CanvasState::aside_second_column`) activates per side only while both columns
  plus the three gaps fit inside the viewport (so the far column never spills past the edge before
  its bubbles appear). Columns are equal width (>= min width, capped at max only when stretching is
  on; both stay at min width and hug the ribbon when stretching is off). Distribution is
  near-priority: isolated bubbles stay near, and only overlapping clusters are split alternately
  near/far. Far links stay roughly horizontal, while the near column packs invisible spacers at each
  far anchor height so near cards spread apart and far links thread between them.
- Persistence and shared-model sync remain in `bubble_runtime.rs`; image text-area parse/serialize
  helpers live in `helpers.rs`.
- A read-only image bubble splits into one `AsideItem` per text area; an editable one stays a single
  card whose blocks each own a colored rect, anchor point, and link.
- This module only drives `CanvasView` through existing runtime/edit helpers.
