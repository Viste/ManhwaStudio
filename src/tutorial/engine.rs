File: src/tutorial/engine.rs

Purpose:
Reusable in-app tutorial / onboarding overlay engine for egui 0.35. It dims the
whole viewport except a rectangular "hole" around one target element (or the
union of a group), draws a dashed outline with padding around the hole, and
shows a text callout beside the hole (biased toward the screen centre) with an
arrow pointing from the callout to the highlight.

Design contract (why it is built this way):
- Targeting is decoupled from the UI. The UI code records the on-screen `Rect`
  of any addressable element once per frame via `TutorialRegistry::mark(key,
  rect)`; a step then references those elements by string key. Pointing the
  tutorial at a real widget therefore needs only that single `mark` line at the
  widget site — no restructuring of the surrounding UI.
- Input is blocked by an OVERLAPPING HITBOX, not by manually disabling widgets.
  A single full-viewport `Area` on `Order::Middle` (above the panels on
  `Order::Background`) allocates one `Sense::click_and_drag` rect over the whole
  screen. egui's hit-test walks layers top-to-bottom and, once a hit covers the
  pointer's search area, drops every widget in the layers beneath it from BOTH
  the click target and the hover set (`WidgetHits::contains_pointer`, which is
  what egui uses for hovering, otherwise keeps lower layers). A full-viewport
  sensor covers that search area at every point, so no panel widget receives
  hover or click. This is why a single full-screen hitbox is used rather than
  four strips around the hole: four strips leave the search area uncovered near
  the hole and at the seams, and hover then leaks to the widgets underneath.
- Consequence: the highlighted element is spotlighted (its region is not dimmed)
  but is itself inert, exactly like everything else outside — the requirement is
  that nothing under the overlay reacts. The dim is painted as four strips around
  the hole purely for the VISUAL cut-out; the hitbox is separate and full-screen.
- Decoration (dashed outline + arrow) is painted through `Context::layer_painter`
  on `Order::Tooltip`, which registers NO widget, so it adds no hitbox.

Key structures:
- `TutorialRegistry` — per-frame map of `&'static str` key -> `Rect`.
- `TutorialStep` — target key(s) + title + body for one step.
- `Tutorial` — ordered step list, current index, active flag, hole padding.

Key functions:
- `Tutorial::render` — draws the whole overlay and advances on button clicks.

Notes:
Verified against egui 0.35 APIs: `Context::viewport_rect` (not the removed
`screen_rect`), `Area`/`Order`, `Ui::allocate_rect`, `Shape::dashed_line`,
`Painter::arrow`, `Context::layer_painter`.

// This is a reusable overlay engine with a deliberately broad public surface
// (start/stop/is_active/sync/render, group targeting, padding). Any single
// consumer — the standalone demo bin or a surface controller — exercises only a
// subset, so unused-item lints here are false positives for a shared engine
// rather than genuinely dead code.
