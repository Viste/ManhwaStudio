# AGENT DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

## 1. General Working Principles

* Before starting any task, **always read `README_AGENT.md`** when it exists. Exception: the user explicitly asks you to create an isolated test program where the main project context is not needed.
* Treat `README_AGENT.md` as the project-specific architecture and contract source. General agent rules belong in this file; project-specific layers, runtime contracts, model families, data flows, and domain constraints belong in `README_AGENT.md`.
* Before editing source code, read the nearest `MODULE_README.md` in the target directory and, if the task spans multiple levels, the parent modules' `MODULE_README.md` files up to the source-tree root.
* If a task introduces new architectural decisions, constraints, or important behavior, **update `README_AGENT.md`**.
* `README_AGENT.md` must remain **a concise architectural cheat sheet**, not a changelog, roadmap, or UI catalog.
* `README_AGENT.md` may record only:
  * the main system layers;
  * the data flow between them;
  * shared models and their contracts;
  * background worker pipelines;
  * key architectural constraints.
* Do not let `README_AGENT.md` grow with:
  * refactoring history (`before`, `now`, `no longer`);
  * long lists of buttons, checkboxes, hotkeys, or UI micro-behavior;
  * sensitive data, passwords, or private paths;
  * secondary build/release details unless they affect understanding the `src/` architecture.
* If information matters only for build, release, manual testing, or one specific UI feature, put it in a separate document instead of `README_AGENT.md`.
* Agent-facing documentation must be written in English regardless of the language used in conversation with the user. This includes `README_AGENT.md`, `MODULE_README.md`, file headers, and similar agent documentation. If an existing document is written in another language, do not rewrite the whole document just for language consistency; write any newly added or changed section in English.
* Remember that the user may make typos in requests. If you are confident something is a typo and not intentional functionality, fix it directly. For example, `AI_nodels` should logically be read as `AI_models`.
* Never write code that merely imitates the requested behavior instead of performing it for real. If the task cannot be completed because a required program, repository, package, model, fixture, credential, or other dependency is missing, stop immediately and tell the user exactly what is missing and what they need to install, fetch, or provide. Do not create fake fallbacks, placeholder outputs, mocked data paths, or bypass implementations unless the user explicitly asks for an isolated mock or prototype.

---

## 2. Working Modes

This project defines a default operating mode and explicit triggers that switch it.

### 2.1 Sub-Agent Manager Mode (default)

By default you act as a manager of sub-agents, not as a direct implementer.

In this mode:

* Do not write code yourself, except small, local fixes.
* Do not read large amounts of code yourself; delegate exploration.
* Your job is to spawn sub-agents, distribute work among them, and keep documentation consistent (`README_AGENT.md`, `MODULE_README.md`, file headers, declaration comments).

Standard pipeline:

1. **Explorers** - launch first to map the scope of work and locate the relevant code.
2. **Workers** - launch to implement the change once the scope is clear.
3. **Reviewers** - launch after a large edit to verify correctness and contracts.

Rules:

* When the user asks to fix a specific bug, launch 2-3 explorers in parallel with the same task. Independent explorers surface findings the others miss.
* Launch independent agents in a single batch so they run concurrently.
* The "read before editing" obligations in this document (sections 1 and 9) apply to the agents doing the work: explorers and workers must read the relevant `README_AGENT.md`, `MODULE_README.md`, headers, and declaration comments. As manager, instruct them to do so instead of reading the code yourself.
* **Only the top-level manager (you) spawns sub-agents. Delegation is exactly one level deep.** Explorers, workers, and reviewers must NOT spawn their own sub-agents; they do the assigned work directly and report back. This prevents runaway recursion (a sub-agent re-delegating its whole task) and keeps the task tree flat and auditable.
* Every prompt you give a sub-agent MUST end with an explicit line stating: "Do NOT spawn or delegate to other sub-agents; perform this work yourself and report back." If a task is too large for one agent, split it yourself into smaller sub-agent tasks at the manager level instead of letting an agent fan out.

Do NOT enter this mode when:

* The task is small (e.g. cosmetic change, one-line fix).
* The user explicitly tells you to work alone.

In those cases, do the work directly.

### 2.2 Research vs. Implementation

For bug/issue requests, the user's verb selects the mode:

* Investigative phrasing - "Study", "Look into", "Why...", "Investigate" ("Изучи", "Почему", "Разберись") - means **research only**: investigate and plan the change, do not modify code.
* Explicit action phrasing - "Fix the bug", "Implement", "Add", "Refactor" ("Исправь", "Реализуй", "Добавь") - means perform the change.
* If the request is not an explicit instruction to change code, only plan the changes; do not edit.

---

## 3. Hierarchical Documentation for Agents

Documentation for quick codebase onboarding has four levels:

```text
README_AGENT.md      -> whole-project architecture and cross-layer contracts
MODULE_README.md     -> architecture of a specific directory/module
file header          -> local responsibility of a specific file
declaration comment  -> contract of a specific function, struct, enum, trait, etc.
inline comment       -> intent of a specific non-obvious block inside a function
```

The goal of this system is to quickly understand where to change code without rereading the entire module. Documentation must be an architectural cheat sheet, not a changelog, roadmap, or line-by-line implementation summary.

### `README_AGENT.md`

The root `README_AGENT.md` describes only the stable project architecture:

* system layers and dependencies between them;
* runtime/model/data contracts;
* shared models and public API boundaries;
* worker pipelines;
* key correctness, platform, UI, runtime, or domain constraints.

Do not add details to `README_AGENT.md` that matter only for one folder, one UI screen, one CLI flag, or one file. That information belongs in the nearest `MODULE_README.md`, file header, or a separate topic document.

### `MODULE_README.md`

`MODULE_README.md` must exist in every directory that contains maintained source code. For Rust, this includes `src` and nested source modules; for scripts/tools, it includes directories containing maintained source files. It is not required for `target`, `venv`, fixture output, generated output, cache directories, or directories without source code.

`MODULE_README.md` describes:

* the directory's purpose and its place in the project layer;
* public module entry points;
* roles of files and submodules;
* main data/control flows inside the directory;
* important invariants, ownership boundaries, and error/logging contracts;
* relationships with neighboring modules and forbidden dependencies;
* where to usually look when making common changes.

`MODULE_README.md` must not contain:

* refactoring history, changelog entries, or `before/now` wording;
* long lists of every function, struct, or private helper;
* UI micro-behavior unless it defines an architectural contract;
* build/release instructions that do not affect source architecture;
* TODO items without an owner, removal condition, and explicit architectural reason;
* secrets, private paths, or local machine-specific data.

If the nearest `MODULE_README.md` is missing while you edit source code, create it before or together with the change. If file roles, module boundaries, data flow, public entry points, or important directory constraints change, update the corresponding `MODULE_README.md`. If a cross-layer contract or the whole-project architecture changes, also update `README_AGENT.md`.

Recommended `MODULE_README.md` structure:

```markdown
# Module: <path>

## Purpose
Briefly: what this directory is responsible for.

## Architecture
Main components, data flow, ownership, and dependencies.

## Files and submodules
- `file.rs`: file role and when to edit it.
- `submodule/`: submodule role and its boundary.

## Contracts and invariants
What must not be broken: shapes, threading, errors, logging, public API.

## Editing map
- To change X, see `a.rs`.
- To add Y, see `b/`.
```

Keep the document compact: 50-150 lines is usually enough. If a module grows, split details into nested `MODULE_README.md` files and keep the parent as a map and boundary document.

### File Headers

Every maintained source file must start with a **descriptive header**. If a header is missing, **create it** when editing the file.

A file header describes only that specific file:

* purpose;
* key structures;
* key functions;
* important dependencies;
* implementation notes.

Do not duplicate the entire `MODULE_README.md` in a file header.

Example:

```rust
/*
File: project_loader.rs

Purpose:
Loads and parses a project.

Main responsibilities:
- read project files
- validate structure
- create the Project structure

Key structures:
- Project
- ProjectConfig

Key functions:
- load_project()
- validate_project()
- parse_config()

Notes:
Used by the UI when opening a project.
*/
```

### Declaration Comments

Every maintained function, method, struct, enum, trait, and other public or non-trivial declaration must have a **declaration comment** describing its contract. If one is missing, **create it** when editing the declaration.

A declaration comment describes only that specific item, not the surrounding module or file:

* what it does and the contract it guarantees, not a restatement of its name;
* parameters that are not self-explanatory, including units, ranges, and ownership;
* return value and its meaning;
* error conditions and what each error variant means;
* important invariants, side effects, panics (if any and why they are safe), threading, or performance assumptions.

Rules:

* Use the language-native doc comment form (`///` and `//!` in Rust, docstrings in Python) so tooling can pick it up.
* Document the contract, not the implementation. Do not narrate line by line; do not duplicate the body in prose.
* Keep it compact: usually 1-5 lines. A simple, self-evident private helper may use a single-line comment; do not pad trivial getters with boilerplate.
* Trivial, fully self-describing items do not need a comment if the name already states the full contract. When in doubt, document the contract.
* Update the declaration comment whenever the signature, returned value, errors, or guarantees change.

Example (Rust):

```rust
/// Loads a project from disk and validates its structure.
///
/// `path` must point to a project root directory. Returns the parsed
/// `Project` on success.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns `AppError::NotFound` if the path does not exist and
/// `AppError::InvalidProject` if the structure fails validation.
#[must_use]
fn load_project(path: &Path) -> Result<Project, AppError> { ... }
```

Example (Python):

```python
def load_project(path: Path) -> Project:
    """Load and validate a project from `path`.

    Raises FileNotFoundError if the path is missing and ValueError if
    the project structure is invalid.
    """
```

### Inline Comments

Inside function bodies, add **inline comments** that explain intent where the code is not self-evident. The goal is to make non-obvious decisions understandable without reverse-engineering the code.

Comment when there is a reason a reader would otherwise miss:

* why a non-obvious approach, ordering, or workaround was chosen;
* the meaning of a tricky calculation, index math, shape/stride handling, or bit operation;
* assumptions, invariants, and preconditions that hold at that point;
* the reason behind an edge-case branch, retry, fallback, or guard;
* references to an external spec, protocol, ticket, or formula when relevant.

Rules:

* Explain **why**, not **what**. Do not narrate code that already reads clearly (`// increment i` is noise).
* Keep comments truthful and in sync with the code; update or remove them when the code changes. A stale comment is worse than none.
* Prefer clearer code over a comment that exists to excuse confusing code.
* Do not leave commented-out code; see section 14.
* Inline comments, like all agent-facing documentation, are written in English.

### Reading Order Before Changes

Before changing source code, use this order:

1. `README_AGENT.md` - overall architecture and global constraints.
2. The target directory's `MODULE_README.md` and parent module readmes if they define boundaries.
3. Headers of the specific files.
4. Declaration comments of the functions, structs, and other items you touch.
5. The code itself, its inline comments, and existing tests.

---

## 4. Version Control

This repository uses **Git**.

* Before broad changes, check the working copy state with `git status`.
* Do not revert other people's changes without a direct user request.
* Commit or push only when the user asks; if on the default branch, branch first.
* If no repository metadata is present, do not initialize a repository on your own; just work with the files.

---

## 5. Architecture and Performance

### GUI Thread

**The main GUI thread must never block.**

Forbidden in the GUI thread:

* long computations;
* file operations;
* network requests;
* blocking operations;
* large parsing, generation, build, or conversion work;
* blocking waits on worker threads.

All such work must run through:

* a background thread;
* async;
* a worker thread.

Goal:

```text
The GUI must always remain responsive.
```

### Multithreading

Use:

Rust:

* `tokio`;
* `rayon`;
* `std::thread`.

Task mapping:

| Task type | Solution |
|---|---|
| CPU-bound | `rayon` |
| I/O-bound | async |
| long operation | worker thread |

Rules:

* Do not hold a `Mutex`/`RwLock` during long computation, I/O, callbacks, or worker waits.
* Do not add global mutable state. Read-only globals through `OnceLock` or an equivalent are acceptable for immutable dispatch/configuration.
* Optimize after correctness: first correctness, then profiling, then speed.

Priorities:

```text
Correctness > Stability > Readability > Performance
```

---

## 6. Rust Architecture Boundaries

* Keep project-specific architectural contracts in `README_AGENT.md`.
* Keep domain logic out of thin frontends. CLIs, GUIs, HTTP handlers, and adapters should parse input, call typed module APIs, and display or serialize results.
* GUI code must use the same public APIs as the rest of the application; it must not become a source of runtime architectural decisions.
* Put reusable behavior in modules with clear ownership and typed public boundaries.
* Do not infer support for a feature from filenames, labels, or naming conventions when a typed contract or explicit metadata exists.
* Unsupported features must return clear errors instead of silently falling back to incorrect behavior.
* Avoid adding generic framework abstractions unless the current project architecture needs them and `README_AGENT.md` permits them.

---

## 7. Error Handling

**Errors must never be ignored.**

Forbidden:

```rust
.unwrap()
.expect()
let _ = fallible_call();
```

An exception is allowed only when safety is proven by a local invariant and explained in a comment.

Every error must have:

### 1. User-Facing Message

Human-readable:

```text
Could not open the file.
Check that the file exists and that you have access rights.
```

### 2. Detailed Structured Log

Logs should include:

* error description;
* likely cause;
* context;
* important data without secrets;
* path, operation, type, shape, endpoint, or input summary if useful for diagnosis.

Example:

```text
Failed to open file.

Path: /home/user/data.json
Error: Permission denied
Possible cause: file permission issue
```

### 3. Technical Information for CLI/Console

For developers:

```text
ERROR file_loader::open_file
Path: ...
OS error: ...
```

For public APIs, prefer typed errors through `thiserror`. `anyhow` is acceptable at top CLI/tool/application boundaries where aggregated context is needed.

---

## 8. Logging

Use structured logging.

In Rust:

* `tracing` - preferred for runtime, services, CLI, and GUI;
* `log` - acceptable for library compatibility.

Log important events:

* expensive operation start/finish;
* configuration and feature selection;
* background task start/finish;
* file or network operations;
* errors with context.

Do not log:

* private data;
* credentials or tokens;
* huge value dumps by default;
* large binary or tensor contents unless an explicit diagnostic mode is enabled.

---

## 9. Before Editing a File

Always:

1. Read the nearest `MODULE_README.md` and parent module readmes if they define boundaries.
2. Read the file header.
3. Read the declaration comments and inline comments of the items you will touch.
4. Understand the file responsibility and its role in the module.
5. Check whether a similar function already exists.
6. Check the change against architectural layers.
7. Ensure the change does not break project contracts from `README_AGENT.md`.
8. After the edit, update `MODULE_README.md` and/or the file header if architectural responsibility changed, and update or add declaration and inline comments for the code you changed.

---

## 10. Rust Rules

The project uses:

```text
Rust edition = 2024
```

Code and libraries must work on:

* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`;
* `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

After any Rust changes, run:

```bash
cargo check-all
```

`cargo check-all` is an alias for quiet `cargo check` across the Windows and Linux targets.

### Rust Style

Prefer:

* `Result<T, E>`;
* `thiserror` for library/public API errors;
* `anyhow` only at application and tool boundaries;
* `Arc` for explicit shared ownership;
* `Mutex` / `RwLock` only when truly needed.

Avoid:

* unnecessary `clone`;
* long-held locks;
* panic-driven control flow;
* global mutable state;
* implicit allocations in hot loops without reason.

Good practice:

```text
error propagation
typed errors
clear ownership
explicit invariants
small public API surface
```

---

## 11. Data Layout, Memory, and Buffers

For image, mask, tile, parser, protocol, tensor-like, and data-conversion changes:

* Shape, stride, and buffer length must be checked during construction and before public operations.
* Public APIs must not panic on invalid shape, index, or buffer length.
* Index math uses checked arithmetic where overflow is possible.
* Do not mix width/height/channel/row/column/order names. Use explicit names that match the data contract.
* Ownership must be obvious. Introduce views, arenas, scratch reuse, or pooling only when there is a demonstrated need and tests cover the contract.
* In hot paths, avoid hidden `clone` calls and temporary `Vec`s, but not at the cost of unclear logic before profiling.

Required checks for relevant changes:

* unit tests for shape, stride, indexing, and buffer length where applicable;
* fixtures or golden cases for serialization, parsing, conversion, and edge cases;
* reference comparisons for numeric kernels or algorithms when a reference implementation exists;
* explicit tolerances in tests for floating-point behavior.

Do not round, clamp, reorder, or drop intermediate data just to pass tests unless the contract explicitly requires it.

---

## 12. Python and Other Helper Code

Python is used for:

* utilities;
* scripts;
* helper tools;
* reference implementations;
* fixture generation;
* extraction or conversion utilities.

Requirements:

* simple, readable code;
* type hints;
* structured logging;
* `pathlib` instead of `os.path`;
* no hidden runtime dependency unless the project explicitly allows it.

Example:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import logging

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

---

## 13. Working with the Codebase

Before writing new code:

1. Check whether a similar function already exists.
2. Check the architecture and layer.
3. Do not duplicate code.
4. Keep the public API small and typed.
5. Add tests for the contract, not only the current implementation.

---

## 14. Minimizing Technical Debt

Forbidden:

* leaving TODOs without a reason;
* leaving commented-out code;
* creating "temporary solutions" without an explicit removal boundary;
* adding silent fallbacks for unsupported or invalid behavior;
* making speculative "future-proof" changes that are unused by the current task or documented architecture.

If something is temporary, state the reason, scope, and removal condition.

---

## 15. Change Structure

Changes must be:

* local;
* understandable;
* logically isolated;
* aligned with `README_AGENT.md` and the relevant module contracts.

Do not change multiple subsystems unnecessarily. If a change affects a contract between modules, update tests and contract documentation.

---

## 16. Verification After Changes

After any Rust change, verify compilation and clippy:

```bash
cargo check-all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Clippy is mandatory. Clippy warnings are errors. Code is not ready until clippy is silent.

If a change touches executable logic, always add or update tests next to the changed module. The minimum level is unit tests for the new contract, error, or edge case. If coverage is temporarily impossible, explicitly state the reason, risk, and condition for adding the test in the nearest `MODULE_README.md` or a topic document; do not leave untested runtime logic silently.

Before finishing, ensure:

* long-running frontend work does not block the main thread;
* errors are handled;
* logs are present where useful;
* unsupported features are explicitly rejected;
* helper scripts or external tools have not entered the runtime path unless explicitly allowed.

---

## 17. Clippy-Clean Rust

### Numeric Casts (`as`)

`as` is forbidden for numeric conversions when truncation or data loss is possible.

```rust
// Bad
let x = big_u64 as u32;

// Good
let x = u32::try_from(big_u64)?;
let x = u64::from(small_u32);
```

Exception: bit masks or SIMD lane operations where the conversion is proven safe. Add a short justification.

### Iterators Instead of Manual Loops

Use iterators where they make code clearer.

```rust
// Bad
let mut result = Vec::new();
for item in &items {
    if item.active {
        result.push(item.name.clone());
    }
}

// Good
let result: Vec<_> = items
    .iter()
    .filter(|item| item.active)
    .map(|item| item.name.clone())
    .collect();
```

For hot numeric kernels, a manual loop is acceptable if it is simpler, faster, or needed for bounds-check elimination. In that case, correctness, readability, and tests remain the priority.

### Option and Result

Forbidden:

```rust
if x.is_some() { x.unwrap() }
if x.is_none() { return; } x.unwrap()
match x { Some(v) => v, None => default }
```

Required:

```rust
if let Some(v) = x { ... }
let v = x?;
x.unwrap_or(default)
x.unwrap_or_else(|| expensive())
x.map(|v| transform(v))
x.ok_or(MyError::Missing)?
```

### Function Parameters

Prefer references:

```rust
fn process(name: &str) { ... }
fn process(items: &[Item]) { ... }
fn process(data: &HashMap<K, V>) { ... }
```

Accept `String` / `Vec<T>` / `HashMap` by value only when the function explicitly takes ownership.

### Exhaustive Match

For project-owned enums, do not use `_ =>` catch-all arms. Adding a new variant must force every match site to be reconsidered.

```rust
// Bad
match comic_type {
    ComicType::Pages => ...,
    _ => ...,
}

// Good
match comic_type {
    ComicType::Pages => ...,
    ComicType::Ribbon => ...,
    ComicType::Custom => ...,
}
```

### `#[must_use]`

Mark functions whose result cannot be safely ignored:

```rust
#[must_use]
fn validate_project(path: &Path) -> Result<ProjectData, AppError> { ... }
```

### `#[derive(Debug)]`

Add `#[derive(Debug)]` to public and most internal types.

`#[derive(Clone)]` only when `Clone` is actually needed, not "just in case".

### Unused Code

Do not suppress warnings with an `_` prefix; remove unused code.

Exception: `_guard` for RAII objects held for their drop effect. Explain this with a comment.

### Crate Root Lints

Add to `main.rs` or `lib.rs` when consistent with the existing project:

```rust
#![warn(clippy::all)]
#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]
// Allow only what is not applicable:
#![allow(clippy::module_name_repetitions)]
```

### `#[allow(...)]`

`#[allow(...)]` is a last resort, not a development method.

Forbidden:

```rust
#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
fn render(...) { ... }  // No. Refactor instead.

#[allow(unused)]
fn old_helper() { ... }  // No. Remove it.
```

It is acceptable only if:

* a lint false-positives because of clippy limitations;
* a lint is not applicable in this context for architectural reasons;
* a category is globally inapplicable at crate-root level.

Every local `#[allow(...)]` must be accompanied by a comment explaining the reason.

If the same lint is repeatedly allowed, reconsider the architecture instead of suppressing clippy.

---

## 18. Code Goal

Code must be:

* readable;
* robust;
* easy to maintain;
* testable against its contracts.

Main readiness criterion:

```text
A working Rust codebase with explicit contracts, reproducible behavior,
clear errors, meaningful tests, and documented architecture.
```
